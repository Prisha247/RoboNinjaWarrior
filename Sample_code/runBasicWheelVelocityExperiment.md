Edit the left and right wheel velocities in this code (``vL`` and ``vR``) to customize your experiment.  The code will set the wheels to these velocities until the user presses the *enter* key.

If you are using the simulated Neato, this script works well with the [makeNeatoPositionPlot](makeNeatoPositionPlot) code.
